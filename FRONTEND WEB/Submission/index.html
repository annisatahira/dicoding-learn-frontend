                  <h2>What is <span>Chocolate?</span></h2>

                  <p>
                    <b>Chocolate</b> is a product based on cocoa solid or cocoa
                    fat or both. The amount and types of cocoa solids and fat
                    that the term implies is a matter of controversy.
                    Manufacturers have an incentive to use the term for
                    variations that are cheaper to produce, containing less
                    cocoa and more cocoa substitutes.
                    <br />
                    There has been disagreement in the EU about the definition
                    of chocolate; this dispute covers several ingredients,
                    including the types of fat used and the quantity of cocoa.

                  <p>
                    <b>Cacao production</b> is labor-intensive. Trees require
                    hand harvesting and machetes, as the pods can reach a size
                    comparable to butternut squash and hold between 30 and 50
                    beans. Cacao trees grown in the wild with shade can maintain
                    production for nearly 100 years. Take that, biennials.

                    The beans, about the size of almonds, are allowed to ferment
                    for 3 to 7 days and then dried. This fermentation is
                    essential — the raw seeds are very bitter. After
                    fermentation beans must be sorted, cleaned, and weighed
                    before roasting. After roasting, the beans enter a machine
                    that cracks the seed coats and blows them away, leaving
                    behind cacao nibs, which are 47% cocoa solids and 53% cocoa
                    butter.
                    <br />
                    Cocoa butter (from cacao) is the main source of fat in
                    chocolate. The chocolate liquor on its own is dry and
                    gritty. Careful heating and cooling will create a stable
                    structure.

                  Chocolate is the swiss army knife of the food world. You can

                  Chocolate may have effects on people’s moods. Most chocolate
                  is eaten in the winter, which suggests that people often use
                  it as a way to beat the seasonal blues.

            Different forms and flavours of chocolate are produced by varying
            the quantities of the different ingredients. Other flavours can be

                  White chocolate is made of sugar, milk, and cocoa butter,
                  without the cocoa solids. It is pale ivory colour, and lacks
                  many of the compounds found in milk and dark chocolates.

                  Dark chocolate, also known as "plain chocolate", is produced
                  using a higher percentage of cocoa with all fat content coming
                  from cocoa butter instead of milk, but there are also "dark
                  milk" chocolates and many degrees of hybrids.

                  One study, published in The Journal of Nutrition, suggests
                  that chocolate consumption might help reduce low-density
                  lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, also known as “bad
                  cholesterol.” The researchers set out to investigate whether
                  chocolate bars containing plant sterols (PS) and cocoa
                  flavanols (CF) have any effect on cholesterol levels.

                  Scientists at Harvard Medical School have suggested that
                  drinking two cups of hot chocolate a day could help keep the
                  brain healthy and reduce memory decline in older people. The
                  researchers found that hot chocolate helped improve blood flow

                  chocolate could help lower the risk of developing heart

                  <br />
                  Based on their observations, the authors concluded that higher

                  Findings published in The Journal of the International Society
                  of Sports Nutrition suggest that a little dark chocolate might
                  boost oxygen availability during fitness training.
                  <br />
                  The scientists believe that the success of dark chocolate in
                  this case is that it contains flavonols known as epicatechins,
                  which enhance the release of nitric oxide in the body.
                  Beetroot juice has a similar effect.

                Antioxidant-rich cocoa products might improve health. This is
                especially true if you substitute a few small squares of dark
                chocolate for high-fat dairy products, processed snack foods or
                cookies in your usual diet.
              </li>

                Milk chocolate is standard junk food. It’s not nutritious nor
                healthy.
              </li>
              <li>
                Real chocolate — the high percentage cocoa stuff — is another
                story. Real chocolate is a very simple product. It contains
                cocoa. And it contains cocoa butter. That’s it.
              </li>
              <li>
                Chocolate creates feelings of pleasure because, well, it tastes
                good and triggers a positive emotional connection. Through an
                endorphin rush, chocolate also brings feelings of love.
              </li>
              <li>
                Finally, most everyone on the face of the planet knows that
                chocolate contains a good amount of calories.
