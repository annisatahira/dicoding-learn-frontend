          <h2>What is Chocolate?</h2>
          <p>
            Chocolate is a product based on cocoa solid or cocoa fat or both.
            The amount and types of cocoa solids and fat that the term implies
            is a matter of controversy. Manufacturers have an incentive to use
            the term for variations that are cheaper to produce, containing less
            cocoa and more cocoa substitutes. There has been disagreement in the
            EU about the definition of chocolate; this dispute covers several
            ingredients, including the types of fat used and the quantity of
            cocoa. In 1999, however, the EU resolved the fat issue by allowing
            up to 5% of chocolate's content to be one of 5 alternatives to cocoa
            butter: illipe oil, palm oil, sal, shea butter, kokum gurgi, or
            mango kernel oil.[

          <h2>Chocolate Variants</h2>
          <p>
            Different forms and flavours of chocolate are produced by varying
            the quantities of the different ingredients. Other flavours can be
            obtained by varying the time and temperature when roasting the
            beans.

              Milk chocolate is solid chocolate made with milk added in the form
              of powdered milk, liquid milk, or condensed milk

            <img />
            <p>
              White chocolate is made of sugar, milk, and cocoa butter, without
              the cocoa solids. It is pale ivory colour, and lacks many of the
              compounds found in milk and dark chocolates. It remains solid at
              room temperature as that is below the melting point of cocoa
              butter.

            <p>
              Dark chocolate, also known as "plain chocolate", is produced using
              a higher percentage of cocoa with all fat content coming from
              cocoa butter instead of milk, but there are also "dark milk"
              chocolates and many degrees of hybrids.

            <p>
              Cocoa powder is the pulverized cocoa solids left after extracting
              almost all the cocoa butter. It is used to add chocolate flavour
              in baking, and for making chocolate drinks.

            Here are some key points about chocolate. More detail is in Benefits
            of Eat Chocolate Article
          </h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Chocolate consumption has long been associated with conditions
              such as diabetes, coronary heart disease, and hypertension.
            </li>
            <li>
              Chocolate is believed to contain high levels of antioxidants.
            </li>
            <li>
              Some studies have suggested chocolate could lower cholesterol
              levels and prevent memory decline.

            <li>Chocolate contains a large number of calories.</li>
            <li>
              People who are seeking to lose or maintain weight should eat
              chocolate only in moderation.

            <h3>Cholesterol</h3>
            <p>
              One study, published in The Journal of Nutrition, suggests that
              chocolate consumption might help reduce low-density lipoprotein
              (LDL) cholesterol levels, also known as “bad cholesterol.” The
              researchers set out to investigate whether chocolate bars
              containing plant sterols (PS) and cocoa flavanols (CF) have any
              effect on cholesterol levels.

          <div class="box">
            <h3>Cognitive function</h3>
            <p>
              Scientists at Harvard Medical School have suggested that drinking
              two cups of hot chocolate a day could help keep the brain healthy
              and reduce memory decline in older people. The researchers found
              that hot chocolate helped improve blood flow to parts of the brain
              where it was needed.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="box">
            <h3>Heart disease</h3>
            <p>
              Research published in The BMJ, suggests that consuming chocolate
              could help lower the risk of developing heart disease by
              one-third.
              <br />
              Based on their observations, the authors concluded that higher
              levels of chocolate consumption could be linked to a lower risk of
              cardiometabolic disorders. They call for further experimental
              studies to confirm whether consuming chocolate is beneficial.

            <h3>Stroke</h3>
            <p>
              Canadian scientists, in a study involving 44,489 individuals,
              found that people who ate one serving of chocolate were 22 percent
              less likely to experience a stroke than those who did not. Also,
              those who had about two ounces of chocolate a week were 46 percent
              less likely to die from a stroke. A further study, published in
              the journal Heart in 2015, tracked the impact of diet on the
              long-term health of 25,000 men and women.

            <h3>Fetal growth and development</h3>
            <p>
              Eating 30 g (about one ounce) of chocolate every day during
              pregnancy might benefit fetal growth and development, according to
              a study presented at the 2016 Pregnancy Meeting of the Society for
              Maternal-Fetal Medicine in Atlanta, GA.

            <h3>Athletic performance</h3>
            <p>
              Findings published in The Journal of the International Society of
              Sports Nutrition suggest that a little dark chocolate might boost
              oxygen availability during fitness training.
              <br />
              The scientists believe that the success of dark chocolate in this
              case is that it contains flavonols known as epicatechins, which
              enhance the release of nitric oxide in the body. Beetroot juice
              has a similar effect.
