      "“Without question, it takes less energy and resources to cook at home,”  says David Pimentel, Professor Emeritus at the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Cornell University.  Pimentel explains it takes seven kilocalories of energy to produce food, but processing, packaging and transporting it takes another ten."

    description:
      "Contrary to all the hype about how eating at Burger King is cheaper than a home cooked meal, this cliché has turned out not to be true.  Now measured in several different ways, the only way fast food is actually “cheaper” is if you compare it solely on calories.  Comparing serving size, weight, or nutritional content, home cooked meals come out ahead in price."

    title: "Food you cook is healthier",
    description:
      "Most people do not cook at home with a deep fat fryer and the majority of home recipes do not call for high fructrose corn syrup.  Simply put, you would be hard pressed to make the food you cook yourself as unhealthy as the frozen pizzas, pre-prepared veggie burgers and fried egg rolls touted to make your life “easier. Plus, the more you process food, the less nutritious it becomes. “Research suggests that people who prepare food at home (versus food prepared outside the home) do eat healthier, emails Juliana Cohen, a Research Fellow in the Department of Nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health”  "
